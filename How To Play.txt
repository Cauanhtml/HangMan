1.Open HangMan.exe

2.A command prompt (game) will appear, and it will say:

	"To play in English, type: English"

3.To play with everything in English, type English.

4.After that, just enter the word that you will discover shortly (it's more fun with 2 players).

5.It will then ask you to enter a letter. The rule is:

6.Choose a letter from the word; repeated letters will deduct one of your lives.

7.The game is very basic and not at all professional XD.

8.To edit the game, if you know programming, open Main.cpp and program as you like. It's open-source.

	Have fun XD!
